This guest book is a bit different from others I've seen, because it
protects against hacker invasion.  It doesn't automatically post every
entry to the public guest book page.  Rather, it archives them in a
private directory until the webmaster(s) get(s) around to confirming
them.  (Or deleting them, or moving them to a "special" page for
safekeeping.)  Furthermore, hacker mischief is discouraged by limiting
the number of entries archived to 100, and by limiting the size of
each entry to 16K, so the absolute worst they can do is use up 1,600K
on your hard drive.

It's also designed to be clean and dignified;  no fancy formatting of
incoming entries is allowed, and HTML codes are stripped, so that
people can't put giant pictures of Barney into your guest book.  See
<http://www.teleport.com/~merlyn/> for why it's a good idea to
Barney-proof your guest book.  Only <p> and <a> tags are allowed.

If you haven't yet seen the guest book in action, you can see what it
looks like to the public, at the Nizkor Project:
<http://www.almanac.bc.ca/guest-book.html>

You can't see the private "webmaster-only" half of it -- the part
where users' entries are confirmed and actually placed on the guest
book -- because, well, because that part is private.  If you want
to see what it looks like, you'll have to install your own copy!

To install your own copy, you'll need these requirements:

                           REQUIREMENTS

1. Access to a computer (unix strongly recommended) that is running
   perl5 (5.001m recommended).  You may be able to convince the code
   to work on a non-unix system or on perl version 4, but don't come
   to me for help.

2. cgi-lib.pl and, if it's not already installed, sufficient security
   clearance to install it.  If you don't know what cgi-lib.pl is,
   visit <http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/web/form.html>.  If you don't know
   whether you have it, look in /usr/local/lib/perl5 and maybe
   /usr/local/lib.

3. A bit of patience, to change all the constants over from my system
   to yours.  This is pretty straightforward.

4. Sufficient security clearance or permission from your sysadmin to
   do each of the following:

   a. To create a "private" directory that your HTTP daemon can access.
      This can be anywhere in the file system, and should not be
      readable by the outside world (unless you don't care if people
      read your incoming entries and your "special guest book," see
      below).  Note that unix HTTP daemons (NCSA, for example) often
      run as user "root" but spawn subprocesses to do real work;  the
      user/group IDs of those subprocesses depend on how the HTTP
      daemon is configured.
   
   b. To install a public cgi-bin program.  If you don't know what a
      cgi-bin is, see
      <http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/CGI___Common_Gateway_Interface/>.
      If you don't know whether you have that clearance, ask around;
      if you still don't know, politely ask your system administrator.
   
   c. To install a private cgi-bin program.  On NCSA httpd, creating
      any private directory means adding a line to the configuration
      file, killing the httpd process, and restarting it. I imagine
      it's similarly painful with other software.  If you're not the
      sysadmin, don't be surprised if your sysadmin balks at doing
      this.  It also requires a bit of knowledge of how user
      authentication works, which for NCSA httpd is pretty simple; see
      <http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/admin/UserManagement.html>.

Got all that?  Good!  Here are the installation instructions.

                           INSTRUCTIONS

1. With your favorite editor, open up both ngb-confirm.pl and
   ngb-sign-in.pl and configure all the constants to be the way you
   like them.  They're all well-marked near the top of each file,
   you can't miss them.

   If you don't know Perl, this may still be a bit intimidating.
   Here's all you need to know.  Any line that starts with "#" is a
   comment.  Any word that starts with "$" is a constant (or a
   variable).  And, I put text into a comment in two ways.  One way
   is with double quotation marks, as in:

      $myConstant = "the text";

   Or, with line-oriented quoting:

      $myConstant = <<END_OF_MY_CONSTANT;
      first line of the text
      second line of the text
      third line of the text
      END_OF_MY_CONSTANT

   It may look confusing at first, but you'll get used to it.  Just
   make sure that if you put any quotation marks into double-quoted
   text, you escape them with a backslash, as in:

      $myConstant = "\"What's up Doc?\" he asked.";

   And with the line-oriented quoting, only alter the text between
   the END_OF_BLAH_BLAH lines, not those lines themselves.
   
   Note that there will be no warnings if you fail to edit any of
   the variables -- things will just be screwy.  You may have a
   link to the Nizkor site, instead of your own, for example.
   Just double-check how it all looks on the web, when you're done.
   
   Note that $guestBookPrivateDir is the directory referred to in
   requirement 4a above.

2. Copy ngb-sign-in.pl to your public cgi-bin directory, referred to
   in requirement 4b above.

3. Copy ngb-confirm.pl to your private cgi-bin directory, referred
   to in requirement 4c above.

4. Run ngb-confirm.pl, either by accessing it through a web browser,
   or by running it from the command line.  This will create the guest
   book file.  (I could have included a dummy guest book file
   separately, but it's less troublesome to put it in the ngb-confirm
   script itself.)
   
   For example, pretend it is in the directory /usr/fred/priv-cgi-bin/,
   which is set up in the HTTP daemon's configuration file to be
   <http://www.myhost.edu/fred-priv-cgi-bin/>. The URL to access it
   from a web browser would be
   <http://www.myhost.edu/fred-priv-cgi-bin/ngb-confirm.pl>.  When you
   access that web page for the first time, you'll see a notice telling
   you that your guest book has been created.

   Or, you could type, from the unix command line,
   "/usr/fred/priv-cgi-bin/ngb-confirm.pl", which would give you a lot
   of HTML code, and somewhere in that code would be the same notice.

5. Call up your guest book file on your favorite web browser and see if
   you like it.  If not, edit it.  You can edit it however you please,
   as long as you don't change the line:
      
   <!-- insert new entries here and do not edit this line -->
   
6. Test the sign-in script on your favorite browser.  If you configured
   all the constants correctly in instruction 1, there should be a link
   to that script right on the guest-book.html page.

   If not, try accessing it manually.  For example, pretend the sign-in
   script is in the directory /usr/fred/pub-cgi/bin/, which is set up
   to be <http://www.myhost.edu/fred-pub-cgi-bin/>. The URL to access
   it from a web browser would be
   <http://www.myhost.edu/fred-pub-cgi-bin/ngb-sign-in.pl>.
   
   Run through the sign-in process, and be sure it gives you the
   message about your entry being added.  Then go to the confirmation
   URL and be sure your entry shows up correctly.  Then delete your
   entry (or add it, if you like).  That's it!  You now have a working
   guest book!

Enjoy.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me at
